# School-Management-System-codeigniter
a school management system built with PHP (Codeigniter)

To run on localhost, clone the repo or request a pull. the database file is located in the root directory "school1.sql"
Import the database file to your mysql database.
I am using codeigniter so you have to go to the /application/config/database.php and set the database values with your database username
and password. If you created the database in different name than "school1" then set the database_name to your database name.

There is a link on the login page to register your school, use that to add a new school with credentials
now login with the newly created details and select the school you created in the schools dropdown. 

enjoy:)
